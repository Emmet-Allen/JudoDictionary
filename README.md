# JudoDictionary

A project using Vanilla JS  to produce a database of quick references for both recognized and unrecognized 
techniques within the martial art of Judo. 

The implementation of this project is to create a database that web developers can use to implement on their websites for users to gain a 
quick grasp of certain elements of a given move. If a user where to look-up a techniques such as "Ippon Seoi Nage", they would be 
able to see: 

1) The Type of Technique 
2) The Sub-Type of the Technique
3) A brief description the of the Type of Technique
4) The Name of the Technique
5) The Belt Level the technique is taught at
6) The English Translation of the Tecnique
7) Tournament Regulation for that Technique
8) If the Technique is Offically Recognized by the Kodokan
9) A link directing to Offical Kodokan Documentation concerning the Technique (if available)
