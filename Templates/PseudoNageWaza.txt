Nage Waza: Throwing Techniques

Divided into 4 sub-techniques:

Te-Waza: Hand-Techniques 
Koshi-Waza: Hip-Techniques 
Ashi-Waza: Foot-Techniques
Sutemi-Waza: Sacrafice-Techniques

Each sub-techniques has unrecognized techniques

Probably best to use an object constructor in general
i.e.

  function JudoDictionary{
  
    function NageWaza{
      
      function TeWaza{
        this.name =
        this.number =
        this.movement =
        this.regulation =
        this.recgnized = 
        this.
        etc...
        }
      }
    }
        
  Probably add some prototypes such as "Hand-Throwing-Techniques" defining the moves within
  the specific movelist themselves
  
  Add a small text describing the movement of the move maybe using 
  i.e. 
  
    ...
    this.description = console.log(" xxyyyzzz ")
  
  or something like that
